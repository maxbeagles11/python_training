# Useful Visual Studio Code Shortcuts and Tips
My editor of choice is VS Code, so I thought I'd share some very useful key bindings and shortcuts that make my life easier at work. I will also include universal tips and tricks.

## VS Code Commands

- Collapse all
```bash
Ctrl+K, Ctrl+0 # Useful for sifting through large files
```

- Expand all
```bash
Ctrl+K, Ctrl+J # Reverts the above command
```

- Replace all
```bash
Ctrl+F2 # This will act as a replace all for any highlighted text
```

## Universal Tips

- Indent highlighted text right
```bash
Tab # Pretty straightforward...tab your text over lol
```

- Indent highlighted text left
```bash
Shift+Tab # Tab your text backwards
```

- Highlight all text in the current line at the cursor position
```bash
Shift+End
```

- Select all text in a file
```bash
Ctrl+A
```

- Save changes
```bash
Ctrl+S # Should be obvious to everyone...
```

- Have cursor at multiple locations
```bash
Alt+Click # Holding Alt and clicking at different spots will add a cursor
```

- Duplicate cursor vertically
```bash
Shift+Alt+Drag # Holding Shift and Alt while dragging your mouse up/down will duplicate the cursor in that column
```
