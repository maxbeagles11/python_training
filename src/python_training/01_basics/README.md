# 01 Basics
Everyone should familiarize themselves with the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). The following are the four main pillars of OOP:
- Encapsulation:
    > This is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit or class. Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object from the outside world, and you interact with the object only through its exposed methods (getters and setters).
- Abstraction:
    > Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by focusing on the essential features and ignoring the irrelevant details. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through classes and objects that provide an interface for interaction, while hiding the implementation details.
- Inheritance:
    > Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (parent class). It promotes code reusability and the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where child classes can extend or override methods of the parent class.
- Polymorphism:
    > Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single interface to represent different underlying forms (types). This can be achieved through method overriding (in subclasses) or method overloading (same method name, different parameters).

These principles help to design **modular, flexible code** that is **easy to maintain**.

As we move through each section, each of these pillars will be put into action, whether you are aware of it or not. You don't need to know the exact definitions, just try to learn what they represent as you go through this training.

I tell everyone the same thing:

`Once you understand that *everything* in Python is an object, it gets a lot easier to learn and code.`


This folder will cover the following basic concepts:
1. Prints and Documentation.
2. Variables.
3. Data Types and Data Structures

Additionally, there are some problems you can try in `try_these_problems.py` to practice what you've learned. The solutions will be found in `solutions.py`.
